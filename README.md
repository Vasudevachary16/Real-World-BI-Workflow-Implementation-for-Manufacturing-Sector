# Real-World-BI-Workflow-Implementation-for-Manufacturing-Sector
I designed and developed a professional-grade end-to-end BI solution for a Manufacturing company, applying real-world business intelligence workflows and tools to turn raw data into powerful insights. This hands-on project followed the complete BI lifecycle—from data prep to dashboard design—simulating the daily responsibilities of a modern data professional.

## 📍 STAGE 1: Data Preparation & ETL
Connected to raw datasets using Power Query, applying automated data cleaning, shaping, and transformation processes.
Utilized data profiling tools, column transformations, and custom M code for a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

## 🔗 STAGE 2: Data Modeling
Designed a relational star schema following best practices in normalization, cardinality, and filter direction.
Built a scalable and high-performance data model, supporting cross-functional analytics.
